CMPSC   203:   Introduction to Spreadsheets and Databases, Fall 2024
Three Essentials before You Start
1.   Laptop Computer with Fast Internet Connection
You need your computer for performing every activity on this course. Bring your laptop to every MW class. You can use either a PC or Mac; however, no other devices such as a cellular phone, tablet, or chrome book are allowed as a main computer device for your coursework and in office hours.
You are responsible for maintaining your computer in a healthy state: constant use of the latest OS (Windows10/11 or MacOS), regular cleanup of your hard drive, use of a solid zipper program such as 7-zip available online etc. If you have a question, contact IT help desk you can access from https://www.it.psu.edu/software/. It is also required to upload your work files on Canvas/MyITLab over a fast and reliable WiFi connection.
2.   Microsoft Office
Microsoft Office is required to be installed on your computer. For PSU students, Office 365 is available free at
https://www.it.psu.edu/software/
Click “Service Login” on the top-right, then select “Office 365”. Press the Install Apps button there to obtain all the Office apps.
There may be some features of Office you cannot use on your computer, e.g., Microsoft Access does not run on Mac; some small feature shortages could be found even on Office 365 for PC that is different from the full version. You’ll have two options to resolve this.
-   WebLabs available for PSU students at
https://webapps.psu.edu/            accessing files at          https://webfiles.psu.edu/   
You can use the same computer environment as an on-campus lab on your web browser. We’ll show how to use it later.    
-   Or visit any on-campus computer lab   to update your homework files there.
If you’re on Mac, you can do more than 85% of the total work on your laptop. If you are on PC with Office 365, you can do more than 95% of the total work on your laptop. For the rest, it is required to use the above to complete your assignments.
3.   MyITLab Account
We will use so-called MyITLab, the cloud learning system for Microsoft Office from the textbook publisher Pearson, for which you need a paid account. See below for details in the textbook section.
You have agreed to the above three at the time of enrollment to the course.
Online Textbook  MyITLab Account
Pearson’s textbook is available online.

·   Have a live chat with Pearson   if you have further questions. It is posted on Canvas how to do it.
2)   Create an account with your credit card number. 
·   Make sure it comes with a MyLab account that we call MyITLab in this course. 
·   Use the same name as your PSU registered name. Chat with Pearson if you need to correct it in an existing or new account. 
3)   After completion, click “Open MyLab Mastering” to visit Pearson.
4)   Click the “Assignments” link to see the published assignments.
All Instructions Are on Canvas
Check our homepage on Canvas before every class.    All the important information will be shown there: homework instructions, schedules, extra course material, quizzes, exam   related information   etc.
Recitation Classes and Friday Video Lectures
Our recitation classes mainly discuss the solutions and tips for homework assignments. As said above, Friday classes are pre-recorded asynchronous video classes, each coming with an assignment to complete except when it is for exam review.

Coverage
This   is an introductory course in computer science, designed especially for non-CSE and non-IST majors. There is no computer programming requirement. However, making some Excel/Access formulas is similar to coding   in   a programming language. We learn important techniques on Excel and Access covering:
·   Excel Chapters 1 to 6 and selected topics in Chap 7-12
·   Access Chapters 1 to 3.      
In regular MW classes, we will cover class files   to learn the chapter skills by entering formulas. Our learning process is partly based on Pearson’s Hands-on Exercises that are carefully designed sets of step-by-step instructions   to master techniques   on Excel and Access. We do selected items on MyITLab and some original projects on Canvas as chapter assignments.
There are two types of work on MyITLab:
·   Simulations: a Pearson server sends you an image showing an Excel sheet asking questions. Answer them by typing a correct formula or click a correct button to move forward. Simulation exercises cover most essential steps of Hands-on Exercises.
·   Grader assignments: download a prescribed Excel file with instructions. Follow the instructions to enter your answer formiulas to complete. Then your uploaded file will be automatically graded by the Pearson server.
There are no trial limits; you can do them as many times as you need before the due dates.
Upon completion, you will acquire skills on:
·   Excel table creation, calculation by functions, drawing graphs, making tables, data aggregation using pivot tables, data analysis tools, text operation techniques, Excel array formulas.
·   Access database creation, data entry tools, and search tools such as filters and queries,
Prerequisite
·   Two entrance units in math are required to take this course.    
·   Minimum knowledge on Microsoft Windows   and applications (cut, copy, paste, web browsing with Microsoft Edge/Mozilla Firefox/Google Chrome, text editing, printing into pdf etc)
Assignments
They are split into four categories to enhance your learning curves effectively. 
1.   Exercises
Weekly simulation exercises assigned from MyITLab.
2.   Daily Quizzes
A small assignment at the end of each Monday/Wednesday class.
3.   Homework
6 grader assignments from MyITLab.   
4.   Projects      
Large scale HW. Each is worth about 5% of your total grade. Their coverages are:
Project 1: Excel Chapters 1, 2, 4
Project 2: Excel Chapters 2-5
Project 3: Excel Chapter 6
Project 4: Text manipulation in Excel
Project 5: Access Chapter 3
Project 6: Array formulas in Excel
Some projects will offer optional extra credit work to enhance your overall score. Especially so-called Extra Credit Work of Type I   coming with Project 2 and 4 could be effective for your score improvement.
Exams
            Schedules: 
Exam   #1: 9:05-9:55am, online 10/4(Fri),
Exam   #2: 9:05-9:55am, online 11/8(Fri),
Online final   exam   will be   scheduled by   the University Registrar’s office.   
Grading 
Exercises 15%, Quizzes 15%, Homework 15%, Projects 30%, Exams 25% (Exams 1  2 each 7.5%, Final 10%)
A; 93%,    A-: 90%,    B+: 87%,    B: 83%,    B-: ,    C+: 72%,    C: 66%,          D:50%,          F:<50%
Score Correction Period (SCP)
The course is split into three thirds, each finished with an exam. After Exam 1 and 2, you must check all your scores   recorded in that third. Notify the instructors of your correction requests   within two weeks after   being announced.      The scores in the third will be fixed after the score correction period.   This rule is essential for maintaining the scores of 50+ items for many students.
